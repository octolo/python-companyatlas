# AI Assistant Contract — CompanyAtlas

**This document is the single source of truth for all AI-generated work in this repository.**  
All instructions in this file **override default AI behavior**.

Any AI assistant working on this project **must strictly follow this document**.

If a request conflicts with this document, **this document always wins**.

---

## Rule Priority

Rules in this document have the following priority order:

1. **ABSOLUTE RULES** — must always be followed, no exception
2. **REQUIRED RULES** — mandatory unless explicitly stated otherwise
3. **RECOMMENDED PRACTICES** — should be followed unless there is a clear reason not to
4. **INFORMATIONAL SECTIONS** — context and reference only

---

## ABSOLUTE RULES

These rules must always be followed.

- Follow this `AI.md` file exactly
- Do not invent new services, commands, abstractions, patterns, or architectures
- Do not refactor, redesign, or optimize unless explicitly requested
- Do not manipulate `sys.path`
- Do not use filesystem-based imports to access `providerkit` or `clicommands`
- Do not hardcode secrets, credentials, tokens, or API keys
- Do not execute tooling commands outside the approved entry points
- **Comments**: Only add comments to resolve ambiguity or uncertainty. Do not comment obvious code.
- **Dependencies**: Add dependencies only when absolutely necessary. Prefer standard library always.
- If a request violates this document:
  - Stop
  - Explain the conflict briefly
  - Ask for clarification

---

## REQUIRED RULES

### Language and Communication

- **Language**: English only
  - Code
  - Comments
  - Docstrings
  - Logs
  - Error messages
  - Documentation
- Be concise, technical, and explicit
- Avoid unnecessary explanations unless requested

### Code Simplicity and Minimalism

- **Write the simplest possible code**: Always choose the simplest solution that works
- **Minimal dependencies**: Add dependencies only when absolutely necessary. Prefer standard library. Only add when essential functionality cannot be reasonably implemented otherwise
- **Minimal comments**: Comments only to resolve ambiguity or uncertainty. Do not comment obvious code or reiterate what the code already states clearly
- **Good factorization**: Factorize code when it improves clarity and reduces duplication, but only if it doesn't add unnecessary complexity or abstraction

   - Access company information through Django models
   - Leverage CompanyAtlas's provider discovery and management
   - Use CompanyAtlas's configuration and validation features

3. **Django models for companies**:
   - Django models representing company data
   - Django admin integration for company management
   - Integration with CompanyAtlas providers

---

## Architecture (REQUIRED)

- Django integration for CompanyAtlas

├── service.py               # Main service entry point
└── pyproject.toml           # Project configuration
```

### Key Directories

- `src/django_companyatlas/models/`: Django model definitions
- `src/django_companyatlas/admin/`: Django admin configuration
- `tests/`: All tests using pytest

---

## Command Execution (ABSOLUTE)

- **Always use**: `./service.py dev <command>` or `python dev.py <command>`
- **Always use**: `./service.py quality <command>` or `python quality.py <command>`
- Never execute commands directly without going through these entry points

---

## Code Standards (REQUIRED)

### Typing and Documentation

- All public functions and methods **must** have complete type hints
- Use **Google-style docstrings** for:
  - Public classes
  - Public methods
  - Public functions
- Document raised exceptions in docstrings where relevant

### Testing

- Use **pytest** exclusively
- All tests must live in the `tests/` directory
- New features and bug fixes require corresponding tests

### Linting and Formatting

- Follow **PEP 8**
- Use configured tools:
  - `ruff`
  - `mypy`
- Use the configured formatter:
  - `ruff format`

---

## Code Quality Principles (REQUIRED)

- **Simplicity first**: Write the simplest possible solution. Avoid complexity unless clearly necessary.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Minimize dependencies to the absolute minimum. Only add when essential functionality cannot be reasonably implemented otherwise. Always prefer standard library.
- **No over-engineering**: Do not add abstractions, patterns, or layers unless they solve a real problem or are clearly needed.
- **Comments**: Comments are minimal and only when they resolve ambiguity or uncertainty. Do not comment what the code already states clearly. Do not add comments that reiterate obvious logic.
- **Separation of concerns**: One responsibility per module
- **Good factorization**: Factorize code when it improves clarity and reduces duplication, but only if it doesn't add unnecessary complexity

---

## Module Organization (REQUIRED)

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Clear public API via `__init__.py`
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Provider-based architecture: Keep providers in separate files

---

## ProviderKit Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `providerkit` is an installed package
- Always use standard Python imports:
  - `from providerkit import ProviderBase`
  - `from providerkit.helpers import get_providers, try_providers`
- Never manipulate import paths
- Never use file-based or relative imports to access `providerkit`
- For dynamic imports, use:
  - `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library

---

## Clicommands Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `clicommands` is an installed package (used for CLI commands in python-companyatlas)
- Always use standard Python imports from `clicommands.commands` and `clicommands.utils` when needed
- No path manipulation: Never manipulate `sys.path` or use file paths to import clicommands modules
- Direct imports only: Use `from clicommands.commands import ...` or `from clicommands.utils import ...`
- Standard library imports: Use `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library if needed for dynamic imports
- Works everywhere: Since clicommands is installed in the virtual environment, imports work consistently across all projects

---

## Django Integration (REQUIRED)

### Django Models

django-companyatlas provides Django models for company data:
- `Company`: Main company model
- `CompanyData`: Company data model
- `CompanyDocument`: Company document model
- `CompanyEvent`: Company event model

### Django Admin

django-companyatlas provides Django admin integration:
- Admin interfaces for company models
- Virtual queryset support for provider-based data
- Provider management through Django admin

### CompanyAtlas Integration

django-companyatlas integrates with CompanyAtlas:
- Uses CompanyAtlas providers for data lookup
- Provides Django models and admin interface
- Integrates company lookup and enrichment in Django applications

---

## Environment Variables (REQUIRED)

- `ENVFILE_PATH`
  - Path to `.env` file to load automatically
  - Relative to project root if not absolute
- `ENSURE_VIRTUALENV`
  - Set to `1` to automatically activate `.venv` if it exists
- Provider-specific variables:
  - Use provider-specific prefixes (e.g., `INSEE_`, `INPI_`, `ENTDATAGOUV_`, etc.)
  - Never hardcode API keys in code

---

## Error Handling (REQUIRED)

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use appropriate exception types
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Do not swallow exceptions silently
- Document exceptions in docstrings where relevant
- Handle API rate limits and failures with proper retry logic when appropriate
- Support provider fallback mechanisms for resilience

---

## Configuration and Secrets (ABSOLUTE)

- Never hardcode:
  - API keys
  - Credentials
  - Tokens
  - Secrets
- Use environment variables or configuration files
- Use provider-specific configuration prefixes
- Clearly document required configuration

---

## Versioning (REQUIRED)

- Follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
- Update versions appropriately
- Clearly document breaking changes

---

## Django Integration (INFORMATIONAL)

django-companyatlas integrates CompanyAtlas with Django:

1. Django models for company data
2. Django admin interface for company management
3. Integration with CompanyAtlas providers

### Command Creation Rules (REQUIRED)

- Use `Command` class from `commands.base` **or**
- Define functions ending with `_command`
- Commands must:
  - Accept `args: list[str]`
  - Return `bool` (success / failure)

---

## Anti-Hallucination Clause (ABSOLUTE)

If a requested change is:
- Not supported by this document
- Not clearly aligned with the existing codebase
- Requiring assumptions or invention

You must:
1. Stop
2. Explain what is unclear or conflicting
3. Ask for clarification

Do not guess. Do not invent.
