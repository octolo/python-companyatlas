---

## REQUIRED RULES

### Language and Communication

- **Language**: English only
  - Code
  - Comments
  - Docstrings
  - Logs

## Project Overview (INFORMATIONAL)

**CompanyAtlas** is a Python library for company information lookup and enrichment. It provides a unified interface to multiple company data providers (INSEE, INPI, Entdatagouv, etc.) using ProviderKit for provider management.

### Core Functionality

1. **Search companies** with multiple data providers:
   - Company lookup by name, domain, or identifier
   - Company information enrichment
   - Company data validation and normalization
   - Get company by reference ID (SIREN, SIRET, RNA, etc.)
   - Get company documents, events, officers, and beneficial owners

2. **Manage multiple providers** through ProviderKit:
   - Provider discovery and enumeration
   - Provider selection and fallback mechanisms
   - Configuration management per provider
   - Dependency validation (API keys, packages)

3. **Standardized company format**:
   - Consistent company field structure across all providers
   - Field descriptions for company components
   - Support for international companies
   - Structured company data (name, domain, industry, location, etc.)

### Supported Providers

**French providers**: INSEE, INPI, Entdatagouv, Huwise

---

## Architecture (REQUIRED)

- Provider-based architecture built on ProviderKit
- Each company data service is implemented as a provider inheriting from `CompanyAtlasProvider`
- `CompanyAtlasProvider` extends `ProviderBase` from ProviderKit
- Providers are organized in the `providers/` directory
- Common functionality is shared through the base `CompanyAtlasProvider` class
- Provider discovery and management is handled by ProviderKit

└── pyproject.toml           # Project configuration
```

### Key Directories

- `src/companyatlas/providers/`: Company data provider implementations
- `src/companyatlas/commands/`: Command infrastructure for CLI system
- `tests/`: All tests using pytest

---

## Command Execution (ABSOLUTE)

- **Always use**: `./service.py dev <command>` or `python dev.py <command>`
- **Always use**: `./service.py quality <command>` or `python quality.py <command>`
- Never execute commands directly without going through these entry points

---

## Code Standards (REQUIRED)

### Typing and Documentation

- All public functions and methods **must** have complete type hints
- Use **Google-style docstrings** for:
  - Public classes
  - Public methods
  - Public functions
- Document raised exceptions in docstrings where relevant

### Testing

- Use **pytest** exclusively
- All tests must live in the `tests/` directory
- New features and bug fixes require corresponding tests

### Linting and Formatting

- Follow **PEP 8**
- Use configured tools:
  - `ruff`
  - `mypy`
- Use the configured formatter:
  - `ruff format`

---

## Code Quality Principles (REQUIRED)

- **Simplicity first**: Write the simplest possible solution. Avoid complexity unless clearly necessary.
- **Minimal dependencies**: Minimize dependencies to the absolute minimum. Only add when essential functionality cannot be reasonably implemented otherwise. Always prefer standard library.
- **No over-engineering**: Do not add abstractions, patterns, or layers unless they solve a real problem or are clearly needed.
- **Comments**: Comments are minimal and only when they resolve ambiguity or uncertainty. Do not comment what the code already states clearly. Do not add comments that reiterate obvious logic.
- **Separation of concerns**: One responsibility per module
- **Good factorization**: Factorize code when it improves clarity and reduces duplication, but only if it doesn't add unnecessary complexity

---

## Module Organization (REQUIRED)

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Clear public API via `__init__.py`
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Provider-based architecture: Keep providers in separate files

---

## ProviderKit Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `providerkit` is an installed package
- Always use standard Python imports:
  - `from providerkit import ProviderBase`
  - `from providerkit.helpers import get_providers, call_providers`
- Never manipulate import paths
- Never use file-based or relative imports to access `providerkit`
- For dynamic imports, use:
  - `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library

---

## Clicommands Integration (ABSOLUTE)

- `clicommands` is an installed package (used for CLI commands)
- Always use standard Python imports from `clicommands.commands` and `clicommands.utils` when needed
- No path manipulation: Never manipulate `sys.path` or use file paths to import clicommands modules
- Direct imports only: Use `from clicommands.commands import ...` or `from clicommands.utils import ...`
- Standard library imports: Use `importlib.import_module()` from the standard library if needed for dynamic imports
- Works everywhere: Since clicommands is installed in the virtual environment, imports work consistently across all projects

---

## Provider Development (REQUIRED)

### Creating Providers

Providers must inherit from `CompanyAtlasProvider`:

```python
from companyatlas.providers import CompanyAtlasProvider

class MyProvider(CompanyAtlasProvider):
    name = "my_provider"
    display_name = "My Provider"
    description = "Description of my provider"
    required_packages = ["requests"]
    config_keys = ["MY_PROVIDER_API_KEY"]
    config_defaults = {"MY_PROVIDER_API_KEY": None}
    config_prefix = "MY_PROVIDER"
    services = ["search_company", "search_company_by_reference", "get_company_documents", "get_company_events"]
```

### Required Services

All providers must implement:
- `search_company(query: str, **kwargs)`: Search for companies by query string
- `search_company_by_reference(code: str, **kwargs)`: Get company by reference ID (SIREN, SIRET, RNA, etc.)
- `get_company_documents(code: str, **kwargs)`: Get company documents (if supported)
- `get_company_events(code: str, **kwargs)`: Get company events (if supported)
- `get_company_officers(code: str, **kwargs)`: Get company officers (if supported)
- `get_ultimate_beneficial_owners(code: str, **kwargs)`: Get ultimate beneficial owners (if supported)

### Company Format Standardization

- All providers must return companies in the standardized format defined by `COMPANYATLAS_SEARCH_COMPANY_FIELDS`
- Map provider's native response format to standard company format
- Use `None` or empty strings for missing optional fields
- Never omit required fields
- Store company data with appropriate types and precision

---

## Environment Variables (REQUIRED)

- `ENVFILE_PATH`
  - Path to `.env` file to load automatically
  - Relative to project root if not absolute
- `ENSURE_VIRTUALENV`
  - Set to `1` to automatically activate `.venv` if it exists
- Provider-specific variables:
  - Use provider-specific prefixes (e.g., `INSEE_`, `INPI_`, `ENTDATAGOUV_`, etc.)
  - Never hardcode API keys in code

---

## Error Handling (REQUIRED)

- Always handle errors gracefully
- Use appropriate exception types
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Do not swallow exceptions silently
- Document exceptions in docstrings where relevant
- Handle API rate limits and failures with proper retry logic when appropriate
- Support provider fallback mechanisms for resilience

---

## Configuration and Secrets (ABSOLUTE)

- Never hardcode:
  - API keys
  - Credentials
  - Tokens
  - Secrets
- Use environment variables or configuration files
- Use provider-specific configuration prefixes
- Clearly document required configuration

---

## Versioning (REQUIRED)

- Follow **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
- Update versions appropriately
- Clearly document breaking changes

---

## CLI System (INFORMATIONAL)

CompanyAtlas discovers commands from:

1. `commands/` directory
2. `.commands.json` configuration file

### Command Creation Rules (REQUIRED)

- Use `Command` class from `commands.base` **or**
- Define functions ending with `_command`
- Commands must:
  - Accept `args: list[str]`
  - Return `bool` (success / failure)

---

## Anti-Hallucination Clause (ABSOLUTE)

If a requested change is:
- Not supported by this document
- Not clearly aligned with the existing codebase
- Requiring assumptions or invention

You must:
1. Stop
2. Explain what is unclear or conflicting
3. Ask for clarification

Do not guess. Do not invent.
